# python - Decision Tree for Hotel Reviews

In this project we will build a decision tree to predict a guest's rating of a hotel (Positive or Negative)
We build a decision tree based on previous guests written reviews and their final rating
We search for some specific keywords in the guests reviews and ---- the rating
After building the tree, we calculate its accuracy
We predict the ratings of some new guests
The program allows us to enter a certain case and predict its rating
The tree is built using (pandas) and (numpy) python packages, and the ID3 method was adopted in this project

We have 3 datasets:
sample_train.csv: we used it to build the tree and to calculate its accuracy.
sample_dev.csv: we used it to check the accuracy for a different dataset than the train sample.
sample_test.csv: we predicted the results of its cases and exported it to an external file called (results.csv).
